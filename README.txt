Music Therapy â€” Facial Expression Demo
This small demo uses face-api.js models loaded from CDN and synthesizes simple sounds with WebAudio.
How to run:
1. Open index.html using Live Server (recommended) or any static file server (models load from CDN).
2. Click 'Start Camera & Audio' and allow camera access.
3. Make facial expressions and you should hear short synthesized sounds mapped to emotions.

This demo intentionally does not include large model files to keep the ZIP small.
