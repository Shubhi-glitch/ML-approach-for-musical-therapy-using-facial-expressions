# ML Approach for Musical Therapy Using Facial Expressions

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **machine learning** and **facial expression recognition** to play personalized music in real-time based on a user's emotions.  
By detecting emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise through the webcam, the system chooses appropriate music or sounds to improve the user's mood.

This can serve as a digital music therapist — providing emotional support, relaxation, and mood enhancement.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect human emotions using **face-api.js**.
- Play music that matches or improves the detected mood.
- Provide an **accessible and automated** form of music therapy for various users.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **face-api.js** (for facial detection and emotion recognition)
- **Web Audio API** / MP3 tracks (for music playback)
- **CDN-based model loading** (to avoid large local model files)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User allows **camera access**.
2. The system detects the face and identifies the **dominant emotion**.
3. Based on the emotion:
   - Happy → Plays energetic or upbeat music.
   - Sad → Plays calming or uplifting music.
   - Angry → Plays relaxing music.
   - Neutral → Plays soft background music.
4. Continues to adapt in real-time as emotions change.
